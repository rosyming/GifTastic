What is this project: This project is a homework assignment for the GATech Coding Bootcamp for the API & Ajax Unit/Module.

About this project: This project uses the GIPHY API to make a dynamic webpage that populates with gifs choice.  The GIPHY API is called and JavaScript and jQuery is used to change the HTML of the site.

Instructions: This is a simple app for finding GIFs from GIPHY. Buttons are pre-populated at the opening of the page.  Clicking on a button will load 10 static GIF images.  Clicking on each image will animate the GIF.  Clicking the animated GIF image again will stop the animation and re-load the still image.  

New buttons can be created that will find GIFs with the same button name.  To create a new button, enter in a button name in the "Enter Button Name" box and click 'Submit' (or hit 'Enter').  Submitting will create a new button in the "Buttons Buttons Buttons" section and clear out the initial search term.  Clicking on the new button will load GIFs related to the new button created.
